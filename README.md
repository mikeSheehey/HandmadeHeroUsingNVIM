# HandmadeHeroUsingNVIM
This repo is what I will be using to host my journey through the Handmade Hero course for game dev on Windows. I will also be learning and using Neovim for the first time and throughout this whole project. I plan to complete 1 lecture a day as well as read at least one document from the vim user manual. 

17MAR26 - Im not sure how I will be making notes yet so for now all will be done here on the readme. The original project is documented by the legendary Casey Muratori. The original looks like it has been retired but assests and source code can still be purchased. 

18MAR26 - A concern I have for this project is what has changed since the start of the series is almost ten years old. Even going throught the first episode the first WinMain funtion has been changed and the original dev site hosted from microsoft (MSDN) doesnt appear to exist anymore and now falls under Microsoft learn. There will probably be a lot of adapting to make some of the practices work.

First thing to notice, the "in" on the syntax for WinMain is used to indicate information is being passed to Microsoft's OS and if there was an "out" it would be giving something back. This notation shows direction that could be processed in some other systems but should not be included when compiling with gcc. The random letters in front of our parameters "HINSTANCE" represents hungarian notation that was adopted to help describe the objects being used when programming. Casey finds them useless. 

First mistake from my end is that I cant compile with gcc or use WSL (without pain in the ass workarounds) if I am dealing with Windows machine dependent headers "Windows.h" so I am going to take a detour and figure out how to install Neovim natively. 

After a bit of research I think the best solution will be to use Mingw for our builds. It looks like the modern version is not limiting. 

20MAR25 - So after a lot of searching there is a few ways to go about working in nvim and building in Windows. The best way I think I have found and will run with is to download VisualStudio so I have access to the powershell developer tools and then can compile there and as for NVIM I dont necessarily need to be in Linux. I have ditched WSL and install NVIM on Windows using a package manager called Chocolatey. Tomorrow i'll give a small "Hello World" program a try and then if all goes well ill continue Casey's series like that. 

21MAR25 - Ive got a test program that compiled with no errors and executed correctly so were back in business.

Today I will be starting to work through the intro C series since I am not too familiar with the language. When explaining more VS essentials we wrote a funtion that included a Windows funtion called OutputDebugStringA(). When running this I didn't see any output in our powershell window and realized that this execution wouldn't contain output from the debugger. I can debug in VS but if I dont want to open VS everytime I debug I can use a sysinternals tool (Dbgview.exe) to display the debug buffer.
